# 10 Astronomy Research Data Things

### Why do you need to manage your research data?

Effective management of research data is increasingly recognised as a critical part of the research process. It enables:
-	Trust in data you obtain for reuse from other sources
-	Reproducibility of research through increasing veracity of data
-	Increased quality of your research
-	Strengthening of researchersâ€™ reputation through increased citations and reach of all research outputs
-	Increased connectivity between all research outputs, and researchers
-	More efficient use of scarce research funds
-	Data description for sharing and collaboration
-	Reduced risk of loss or corruption of data


### How can I work through these Things?
-	All Things have 1 to 3 Activities. You can pick and mix from the Activities to suit your interests. 
-	You can do as much or as little of the Things and Activities as you want to do, or need to know. 
-	Some of the Activities are intended as an introduction to a topic, and some delve a little deeper. Choose what interests you and suits your experience.
-	You can work through Activities on your own at your own pace, or in a group.
